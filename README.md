Sleep Health and Lifestyle Analysis

This project analyzes a dataset containing information about sleep health and lifestyle factors, with a focus on key columns such as Gender, Age, Occupation, and Heart Rate. The goal is to uncover insights about how these factors influence sleep duration, quality, and overall lifestyle patterns.

Using Matplotlib and Seaborn, the project creates insightful visualizations such as bar charts, scatter plots, and heatmaps. These visualizations explore trends in sleep quality across different age groups, occupations, and genders, as well as correlations between heart rate, stress levels, and physical activity. This analysis highlights how demographic and physiological factors impact sleep health, providing actionable insights for promoting better lifestyle choices and sleep hygiene.

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of data analysis and visualization in understanding complex relationships within health-related datasets. It aims to support researchers and healthcare professionals in identifying key determinants of sleep health and devising strategies to improve overall well-being.
